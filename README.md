# 🎯 Number Guessing Game 

A fun number guessing game built entirely in **vanilla JavaScript**, using only built-in browser dialogs: `prompt()`, `alert()`, and `confirm()` — no HTML or CSS required.
## 🕹️ Features

- Guess a random number between **1 and 100**
- Validates input: **whole numbers only**
- Gives feedback: _Too high_, _Too low_, or _Correct!_
- Limits number of attempts
- Option to **play again** after each round
- Handles invalid inputs and user cancellations

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open your browser's developer console (F12 or right-click → _Inspect_ → **Console**)
2. Paste the entire game code into the console (script.js)
3. Hit **Enter** and play the game

Alternatively, create a local `.js` file and run it in the browser using a bookmarklet or dev console.
